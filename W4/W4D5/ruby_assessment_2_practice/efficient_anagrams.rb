# Write a method `anagrams(str_1, str_2)` that takes in two strings and returns
# a boolean indicating whether or not the two strings are anagrams. Two strings are
# anagrams if they contain the same exact characters, but not necessarily in the
# same order.
#
# Your solution should have a linear - O(n) runtime, where n is the combined
# length of the input strings.
#
# Scoring: 8 points maximum
#   4 points awarded for passing all seven test cases
#   4 points awarded for linear runtime
#
# This component of the assessment is estimated to take 10 minutes.
